# Chapter 4

I've been looking for a simple list of type.. types for ages

- Enumerated types—Types defined by giving the possible values directly

- Union types—Enumerated types that carry additional data with each value

- Recursive types—Union types that are defined in terms of themselves

- Generic types—Types that are parametrized over some other types

- Dependent types—Types that are computed from some other value
